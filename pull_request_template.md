Please answer the following questions about your work:

1- Have you manually tested the solution?
Yes

2 - Did you add a test suite? If so, how will we use it? If not, why?
No, I did not have time I worked more on the UI/UX

3 - Did you use any 3rd party library? Why did you use it? What are the tradeoffs?
Yes, React-Query, Axios and Grommet
For Grommet the trade offs are little to no time building layout but trade offs are working around their way of scaffolding using Grid/Box components.

4 - Do you feel the UI/UX makes it easy to navigate the data from the API?
Yes

5 - If you had more time, what else would you add?
I would add more tests and improve the loading animations of the UI

6 - What would you change in your current solution?
I would like to add filter and sorting for characters

7 - On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the highest), how would you rate this solution?
8

8 - Anything else we should keep in mind when we evaluate the project?
